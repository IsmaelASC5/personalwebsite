                <h2>Past</h2>
                <p id = "he">     Growing up computers were still new to me and my family. My brother used to fix electronics for people.
                        So I would sit on the bed and watch what he did. Now I was only 6 years old and to be honest with you I 
                        didnt understand what he was doing, but it did drive me to try and go and learn my own part of the tech
                        Industry. Which works good for me because I enjoy working alone.</p>

                <h2>Present</h2>
                <p id = "he">All Star Code is the beginning of my career in the tech industry by learning code. I plan to use it, keep my 
                    momentum going and use what i've learned as an advantage to help me in college hopefully landing a job at 
                    Goldman Sachs. I would like to be in the cybersecurity part of Goldman more than anything.

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p id = "he">I aspire to be Mr. Robot. I know theres two things wrong with that. 1. He did a lot of things that are illegal. 
                    2. He's a fictional character. But when I say I aspire to be him I mean to have the amount of knowledge he does 
                    and ability to do what he wants with it.
